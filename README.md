# JohnHiro84

This is my github pages project showcasing 
different projects I've done in the past.

Most recently I finished App Academy's
curriculum. In the past, I've completed courses
From codecademy(React), some basic courses from 
the city college of San francisco(html/css/js),
Responsive design and images from Udacity, and 
a backend course from free code camp (using mongoDb,
Node and express).
