# JohnHiro84

This is my github pages project showcasing 
different projects and coursework I've completed in the past.


Most recently I finished App Academy's bootcamp
curriculum. The bootcamp teaches Ruby, Rails, SQL, mongoDb, react and the Mern stack.
In the past, I've completed courses
from Codecademy(React), some basic courses from 
the city college of San francisco(html/css/js),
Responsive design and images from Udacity, and 
a backend course from free code camp (using mongoDb,
Node and express).
